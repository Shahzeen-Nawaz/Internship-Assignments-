Installation of Numpy

To install NumPy in a Google Colab notebook, use the following code in a code cell:

python
!pip install numpy

Then press `Shift + Enter` to execute the cell.



Hereâ€™s a short example demonstrating NumPy:

python
import numpy as np

Create a NumPy array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

Basic operations
print("Array:", array)
print("Mean:", np.mean(array))
print("Sum:", np.sum(array))

Type this into a code cell and press `Shift + Enter` to run it.
