Python Official Documentation 

The Python Official Documentation tutorial covers the fundamental concepts and features of Python in a detailed and structured manner:

1. Introduction to Python:
   - Overview of Python, its features, and a simple "Hello, World!" example.
     print("Hello, World!")

2. Using the Python Interpreter:
   - Basics of using the Python interpreter and running Python scripts.

3. An Informal Introduction to Python:
   - Data types and operations:
     - Numbers:
       x = 10
       y = 3.14
       
     - Strings:
       s = "Hello"
       
     - Lists:
       fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

4. More Control Flow Tools:
   - Conditional Statements: if, elif, else.
     if x > 5:
         print("x is greater than 5")
         
   - Loops: for and while.
     for i in range(5):
         print(i)

5. Data Structures:
   - Lists: Detailed list operations.
     fruits.append("orange")
     
   - Tuples: Immutable sequences.
     coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
     
   - Dictionaries: Key-value pairs.
     person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
     
   - Sets: Collections of unique elements.
     unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}

6. Modules:
   - Importing and using modules.
     import math
     print(math.sqrt(16))

7. Input and Output:
   - Reading from and writing to files.
     with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
         content = file.read()

8. Errors and Exceptions:
   - Handling exceptions using try, except, and finally.
     try:
         result = 10 / 0
     except ZeroDivisionError:
         print("Cannot divide by zero.")

9. Classes:
   - Basics of object-oriented programming, defining classes, and creating objects.
     class Person:
         def __init__(self, name, age):
             self.name = name
             self.age = age
     
     person = Person("Alice", 30)

10. Standard Library:
    - Overview of Python's extensive standard library and its modules.
