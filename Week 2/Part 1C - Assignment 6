Here’s how to navigate the file system using basic command-line commands in both Windows Command Prompt and Linux terminal:

Windows Command Prompt

1. Display the Current Directory:
   cd
   - This command shows the path of the current directory.

2. List Files and Directories:
   dir
   - Lists all files and directories in the current directory.

3. Change Directory:
   cd <directory_name>
   - Changes to the specified directory. For example, cd Documents will navigate to the "Documents" directory.

4. Go Up One Level:
   cd ..
   - Moves up one level in the directory structure.

5. Absolute Path Navigation:
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
   - Navigates directly to the specified absolute path.

Linux Terminal

1. Display the Current Directory:
   pwd
   - Prints the current working directory path.

2. List Files and Directories:
   ls
   - Lists files and directories in the current directory. Use ls -l for detailed information.

3. Change Directory:
   cd <directory_name>
   - Changes to the specified directory. For example, cd Documents will navigate to the "Documents" directory.

4. Go Up One Level:
   cd ..
   - Moves up one level in the directory structure.

5. Absolute Path Navigation:
   cd /home/yourusername/Documents
   - Navigates directly to the specified absolute path.

Summary

- cd: Change directory.
- ls (Linux) / dir (Windows): List files and directories.
- pwd (Linux): Print working directory.

These commands provide the fundamental tools for navigating and managing files in your system's command-line interface.



Here’s how to create, copy, move, and delete files and directories using command-line commands in both Windows Command Prompt and Linux terminal:

Windows Command Prompt

1. Create a File:
   echo. > filename.txt
   - Creates a new file named filename.txt. You can also use type nul > filename.txt or copy nul filename.txt.

2. Create a Directory:
   mkdir directory_name
   - Creates a new directory named directory_name.

3. Copy a File:
   copy source_file.txt 
   destination_file.txt
   - Copies source_file.txt to destination_file.txt.

4. Copy a Directory:
   xcopy source_directory
   destination_directory /s /e
   - Copies source_directory to destination_directory, including all subdirectories and files. The /s flag copies directories and subdirectories except empty ones, and the /e flag includes empty directories.

5. Move a File:
   move source_file.txt
   destination_directory\
   - Moves source_file.txt to destination_directory.

6. Move a Directory:
   move source_directory
   destination_directory\
   - Moves source_directory to destination_directory.

7. Delete a File:
   del filename.txt
   - Deletes filename.txt.

8. Delete a Directory:
   rmdir /s /q directory_name
   - Deletes directory_name and all its contents. The /s flag removes all directories and files within the specified directory, and the /q flag suppresses confirmation prompts.

Linux Terminal

1. Create a File:
   touch filename.txt
   - Creates an empty file named filename.txt. You can also use echo "" > filename.txt to create a file with an empty string.

2. Create a Directory:
   mkdir directory_name
   - Creates a new directory named directory_name.

3. Copy a File:
   cp source_file.txt
   destination_file.txt
   - Copies source_file.txt to destination_file.txt.

4. Copy a Directory:
    cp -r source_directory
    destination_directory
   - Copies source_directory to destination_directory, including all subdirectories and files. The -r (recursive) flag is required for directories.

5. Move a File:
   mv source_file.txt
   destination_directory/
   - Moves source_file.txt to destination_directory.

6. Move a Directory:
   mv source_directory
   destination_directory/
  - Moves source_directory to destination_directory.

7. Delete a File:
   rm filename.txt
  - Deletes filename.txt.

8. Delete a Directory:
   rm -r directory_name
   - Deletes directory_name and all its contents. The -r (recursive) flag is required for directories. Use rm -rf directory_name to force delete without confirmation prompts.

Summary

- Create File: echo. > filename.txt (Windows) / touch filename.txt (Linux)
- Create Directory: mkdir directory_name
- Copy File: copy source_file.txt destination_file.txt (Windows) / cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt (Linux)
- Copy Directory: xcopy source_directory destination_directory /s /e (Windows) / cp -r source_directory destination_directory (Linux)
- Move File: move source_file.txt destination_directory\ (Windows) / mv source_file.txt destination_directory/ (Linux)
- Move Directory: move source_directory destination_directory\ (Windows) / mv source_directory destination_directory/ (Linux)
- Delete File: del filename.txt (Windows) / `rm filename.txt (Linux)
- Delete Directory: rmdir /s /q directory_name (Windows) / rm -r directory_name (Linux)

These commands provide essential file and directory management capabilities from the command line.
